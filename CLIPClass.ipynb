    "- **`__init__(self, model_name='ViT-B/32', device=None)`**\n",
    "  - Initializes the model with a specified model name and device. Defaults to using CUDA if available. It sets up the optimizer and default parameters for the model. And casts it to float 32 to use ADAM. Also sets a `changeseed` to be able to have different random generations in a loop for Entropy Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizer Methods\n",
    "- **`use_ADAM(self)`**\n",
    "  - Changes the optimizer of the model to ADAM.\n",
    "- **`use_SGD(self)`**\n",
    "  - Switches the optimizer to SGD.\n",
    "- **`convert_model_parameters_to_float32(self, model)`**\n",
    "    - This is for ADAM to work. Converts all model parameters to float32 data type.\n",
    "- **`grad_descent_step(self, loss)`**\n",
    "    - Performs a single gradient descent step using the computed loss, updating the model parameters accordingly. This is what modifies the clip model stored in the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Handling\n",
    "- **`require_CLIP_gradients(self, state=True)`**\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data Handling\n",
    "- **`load_data(self)`**\n",
    "  - This is just to have some data easy to access to test the methods on some image. Loads the CIFAR100 dataset which is useful for testing or validating the model performance on image data.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Tokenization of labels\n",
    "- **`tokenize_labels(self, classes)`**\n",
    "    - Converts a list of class labels into text tokens using CLIP's tokenizer and encodes them into text features. This is used for matching text descriptions with images. For now this is just used with a photo of a {class} and then stored as an attribute so that we can reuse it for every method.\n",

    "Test-Time Prompt Tuning (TPT) is a method designed to enhance the performance of vision-language models like CLIP by adapting the text prompts dynamically at test time. This approach is particularly useful in zero-shot learning scenarios where the model needs to generalize to new tasks without additional training.\n",

    "\n",
    "TPT optimizes the text prompt to improve consistency and confidence in the model's predictions across various augmented views of a test image. By minimizing the entropy of the prediction distribution average across low-entropy augmentations, TPT attempts to make the model more reliable and robust, even under slight variations in input data.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Initial Setup\n",
    "- **Model Preparation**: Initialize the pre-trained CLIP model using `CLIPModel(model_name='ViT-B/32')`.\n",
    "- **Prompt Initialization**: Start with a basic prompt template like \"a photo of a {object}\", processed using the `tokenize_labels` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Augmentation and Prediction\n",
    "- **Generate Augmented Views**: Create multiple augmented versions of the test image using the `augment_image` method, which might include crops, rotations, and color adjustments, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Define the Optimization Objective\n",
    "The goal is to minimize the entropy of the predicted probability distribution across different classes for the test image, computed using the `entropy_loss_TPT` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Equation for Entropy Minimization:\n",
    "\\\\[ p^* = \\arg\\min_p -\\sum_{i=1}^K \\tilde{p}_p(y_i | X_{\\text{test}}) \\log \\tilde{p}_p(y_i | X_{\\text{test}}) \\\\]\n",

    "- \\\\( p^* \\\\) is the optimized prompt.\n",
    "- \\\\( K \\\\) is the number of classes.\n",
    "- \\\\( \\tilde{p}_p(y_i | X_{\\text{test}}) \\\\) is the averaged predicted probability for class \\( y_i \\) also returned in `entropy_loss_TPT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Averaged Prediction Probability defined as:\n",
    "\\\\[ \\tilde{p}_p(y_i | X_{\\text{test}}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N p_p(y_i | A_i(X_{\\text{test}})) \\\\]\n",
    "- \\\\( N \\\\) is the number of augmented views.\n",
    "- \\\\( A_i(X_{\\text{test}}) \\\\) denotes the \\( i \\)-th augmented view of the test image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Optimize the Prompt\n",
    "In the paper, they use gradient-based optimization to adjust the prompt parameters (provided by CoOp or CoCoOp) by minimizing the entropy. In our case, we decided that training CoOp or CoCoOp is not what we want to focus on for the project, therefor, for now what `TPT` method gives us is a evaluation of how good the prompts are that we will use to guide a wider classification method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Confidence Selection\n",
    "Filter out noisy predictions by applying a confidence selection mechanism (`confidence_selection`) that discards the augmentations with the highest entropy (over a threshold value).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Confidence-Based Averaging:\n",
    "\\\\[ \\tilde{p}_p(y | X_{\\text{test}}) = \\frac{1}{\\rho N} \\sum_{i=1}^N 1[H(p_i) \\leq \\tau] p_p(y | A_i(X_{\\text{test}})) \\\\]\n",
    "- \\\\(\\rho\\\\) is the cutoff percentile on the N augmented views (set to 0.8 by default in our implementation).\n",
    "- \\\\( 1[H(p_i) \\leq \\tau] \\\\) is an indicator function that filters predictions based on their entropy \\\\( H \\\\), with \\\\( \\tau \\\\) being a threshold set in the `confidence_selection` method as the entropy of the \\\\(\\rho\\\\) percentile. We are removing the augmentations with the highest entropy in the top 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Final Prediction\n",
    "Apply the optimized prompt to make the final prediction on the original test image using the `TPT` method, which performs the entire sequence described above except for the prompt optimization which we will implement in other method without using CoOp or CoCoOp.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "Apart from what the paper says, I TPT alone without prompt optimization returns the averaged probability over low-entropy augmentations without doing any training. This is basically saying that all the top 80% lowest entropy augmentations are equally valid and averages the predictions across them, so the original image does not have more weight in the output than the augmentations. This is not the use proposed bythe paper but I am runing it as well to see how it does. I mean, the idea is not that crazy actually, although it is quite sensitive to the kind of augmentations we do (if we have bad augmentations in the low entropy 80%, we will be saying that those are equally valid)."
